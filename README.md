# Calculator
In this project I created a calculator using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.

What I have learned:
- Improved my JS skills
- Adding keyboard support/keyboard events
- Working with data attributes instead of classes

What should I improve:
- Commit more often with focusing on clear and summarized commits
- Code readability and organization
- Lack of CSS variables usage
