This is a simple calculator project implemented using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Clear button to reset the calculator display.
- Responsive design for use on different devices.

What I have learned:

- Improved my JS skills
- Adding keyboard support/keyboard events
- Working with data attributes instead of classes

What should I improve:

- Commit more often with focusing on clear and summarized commits
- Code readability and organization
- Lack of CSS variables usage
